# MEAN Stack

MEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.  

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

### Optional (Requirements for Grunt)
* Ruby - Download and Install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).
* Ruby Gems - Download and Install [Ruby Gems](http://rubygems.org).
* Compass - an open-source CSS Authoring Framework, install via [Ruby Gems](http://rubygems.org).
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

## Quick Install

 The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

  We recommend using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:

    $ grunt

  When not using grunt you can use:

    $ node server
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000
